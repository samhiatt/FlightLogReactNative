Had light headwind and small thermals kept lifting me up, and I also realized later that the terrain was sloping downward so I was probably going to overshot the clearing and run into a stable, so I made a last second 180 turn. Was almost through the turn when I hit the ground, just a few feet from a big rock, and then my canopy draped over the top of two mesquite thorn trees. Somehow I only got a small scratch on my ankle during impact and a couple on my hands while retrieving my wing and only a tiny, less than a quarter inch tear at the trailing edge of my wing.

After hitting 10,700 I headed towards San Agustin and worked the thermal there before heading towards town. Was pretty windy and I want able to find enough thermals to make it to the lake, so I chose a large field in Casas Viejas and worked my way down and did a nice spot landing by a super nice house. Apparently it was el rancho de Checa, se supone un medio narco. Another paraglider landed there just after me, followed by a hang glider which did a super nice landing.

Caught a good thermal in the first few minutes and climbed back to launch level. Fairly rowdy thermal and I was worried about being in the rotor, so I headed out over the valley. Nice and smooth coming down. Good approach and nice spot landing in light wind. ",,,
